📰 Fake News Detection with Machine Learning
This project aims to detect fake news using supervised machine learning techniques. By training models on labeled news data, it classifies articles as either real or fake, helping combat misinformation in the digital age.
🚀 Overview
- 🔍 Binary classification: Real vs. Fake news
- 🧠 Models used: LogisticRegression and DecisionTreeClassifier
- 📊 Feature extraction via TF-IDF
- 🧪 Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- 🐍 Built with Python and scikit-learn

🧠 Algorithms
- **Logistic Regression** A linear model ideal for binary classification tasks 
- **Decision Tree** A non-linear model that splits data based on feature thresholds

Absolutely, Arian! Here's a polished and professional README.md tailored for your Fake News Detection project using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier. It’s designed to impress collaborators, recruiters, or anyone browsing your GitHub:
